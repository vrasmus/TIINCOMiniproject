\subsection{Markov Burst Error Channels}
While the BSC is easy to deal with in theory, in many cases it does not match the reality well. In practice, errors are not entirely independant and random. Effects such as deep fades in wireless channels cause the probability of a symbol being in error to be much larger if the previous symbol was an error. This causes errors to appear in bursts. A simple model of such a channel can be created by using a Markov chain.
